# Fly.Buy
Python | Web-Scrapping | Web-Development

## Introduction
 Did you ever go to multiple stores just to make sure that you do not pay more for your product?
 For offline shoping we often do not do price comparision, or if we do, it takes a lot of time and money. *Fly.Buy* will let you compare price between many stores and you can directly order sitting on your couch.
 *Fly.Buy* is a desktop application which compares the prices of the product from a variety of stores for you. It gives you a complete comparision chart of the product with the best price output.
<!--
 For simplicity, the prices are scrapped from www.groffers.com and www.super99.com.
 
-->
 As a seller if you do not have your own website, we provid you the platform to enter your data once. We would make sure that buyers are informed about your product if their requirement matches.

## The problem *Fly.Buy* solves
Bored of searching “places near by me” and going to each local shop to compare the local prizes . So what if there is an advanced technology that scans the prizes of the required product and shows you the comparison of all local shops nearby for that particular product? This advanced GUI helps you fetch the prices of a product you'd want from several sources and you'll be handy with the cheapest store form where you could buy the product.
an not do price comparision, but this will let you  compare price between many stores and you can directly order
